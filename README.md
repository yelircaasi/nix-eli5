# nix-eli5

Source for a static website containing unofficial documentation for Nix and NixOS, designed to be as clear and accessible as possible.

## Goals

* accessibility - explanations should be geared toward new Nix/NixOS users
* clarity - make assumptions and background knowledge explicit; when in doubt, explain too much rather than too little
* thoroughness - goes hand-in hand with the other two: the objective is to reach a deep and satisfying level of understanding, to really grok Nix; "enough knowledge to somehow get NixOS up and running" is already out there in many other guides

## Non-Goals

* complete coverage - this isn't here to deal with every single topic in and around Nix
* ad hoc details - while examples serve to illustrate general principles, these docs are a toolbox rather than a cookbook - they aim to give an understanding of the fundamentals, which will then make it much easier to find solutions to specific problems: "Build a man a fire and you keep him warm for a few hours. Set a man on fire and you keep him warm for the rest of his life."
